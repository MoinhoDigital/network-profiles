# Example profiles

These are example community profiles of libremesh which might be used as basis for other community profiles.
It is not recommended to create a firmware based on any of these profiles. They might be broken or incomplete, as they are only examples.

# List

  * adhoc: use ad-hoc instead of ieee80211s for meshing
  * encrypt-11s: adds an encryption layer to the mesh backbone (default password libremesh)
  * encrypt-11s+ap: encrypt both Mesh and AP and let them run on differnt interfaces. Requires dualband router.
  * odhcpd: enables odhcpd as default DHCP server instead of dnsmasq
  * only-bmx6: uses only bmx6 as routing protocol (disable batman-adv and anygw), each node has an autogenerated /27 sub-network (32 IPs) for its AP clients
  * only-bmx7: same as **only-bmx6**
